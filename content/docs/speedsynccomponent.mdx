# MotionSpeedSyncComponent

The `UMotionSpeedSyncComponent` synchronizes the MaxWalkSpeed attribute from a UMotionAttributeSet to the MaxWalkSpeed property of a UCharacterMovementComponent on the same actor.

## Overview

This simple but essential component creates a bridge between the Gameplay Ability System's attribute-based speed management and the Character Movement Component's actual movement speed. It listens for changes to the MaxWalkSpeed attribute and applies them to the CMC property.

## Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `bShowDebugInformation` | `bool` | If true, prints debug information to the screen |

## Functions

| Function | Return Type | Description |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| `PrintDebugInformation` | `void` | Prints current sync status and values to the screen |

## Usage

Add this component to your character if you're using `UMotionAttributeSet` or a custom AttributeSet that has a MaxWalkSpeed attribute. The component will:

1. Find the Ability System Component and Character Movement Component
2. Listen for changes to the MaxWalkSpeed attribute
3. When the attribute changes, update the Character Movement Component's MaxWalkSpeed property

## Requirements

- Your character must have an Ability System Component
- The ASC must have an AttributeSet with the MaxWalkSpeed attribute (e.g., UMotionAttributeSet)
- Your character must have a Character Movement Component

## Example

```cpp
// Inside your character class setup
UMotionSpeedSyncComponent* SpeedSyncComp = CreateDefaultSubobject<UMotionSpeedSyncComponent>(TEXT("SpeedSyncComponent"));
// No additional configuration is typically needed
```

## Gameplay System Integration

1. Create Gameplay Effects that modify the MaxWalkSpeed attribute (Add, Multiply, or Override)
2. Apply those effects using your character's Gameplay Abilities (e.g., Sprint, Crouch)
3. The SpeedSyncComponent will ensure the CharacterMovementComponent's MaxWalkSpeed stays in sync

## Blueprint Usage

After adding the component to your character blueprint in the Components panel:

1. Select the MotionSpeedSyncComponent in the Components panel
2. Enable bShowDebugInformation if you want to verify it's working
3. No other configuration is typically required
