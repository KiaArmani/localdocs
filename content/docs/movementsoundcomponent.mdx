# MotionMovementSoundComponent

The `UMotionMovementSoundComponent` is responsible for triggering movement-related sound effects by executing Gameplay Cues based on context (movement event, surface type, character state). It's designed to trigger locally predicted cosmetic Gameplay Cues.

## Overview

This component handles footstep and landing sound/effect triggering based on the current surface type, movement state, and environmental context. It uses a DataTable to map Physical Surface Types to effect assets and executes Gameplay Cues with rich context information.

## Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `SurfaceEffectsTable` | `TSoftObjectPtr<UDataTable>` | Data Table mapping Physical Surface Types to effect assets (sounds, visuals) |
| `GenericFootstepCueTag` | `FGameplayTag` | The Gameplay Cue Tag to execute for footstep/movement effects |
| `MinTimeBetweenFootsteps` | `float` | Minimum time in seconds between footstep effect triggers to prevent spamming (0 to disable) |
| `MinTimeBetweenLandings` | `float` | Minimum time in seconds between landing effect triggers (0 to disable) |
| `EnvironmentCheckRadius` | `float` | Radius for the sphere overlap check used to detect environmental context (e.g., 'Wet') |
| `EnvironmentCheckChannel` | `ECollisionChannel` | Collision channel used for the environmental overlap check |
| `FootstepSocket_L` | `FName` | Socket name on the character mesh for left footstep sounds |
| `FootstepSocket_R` | `FName` | Socket name on the character mesh for right footstep sounds |
| `SurfaceTraceChannel` | `ECollisionChannel` | Trace channel used for detecting the ground surface type |
| `SurfaceTraceDistance` | `float` | Max distance to trace downwards to find the ground surface |
| `HardLandThreshold` | `float` | Impact velocity threshold after which a landing is treated as "hard" |
| `bShowDebugInformation` | `bool` | Optional flag to show debug information (trace lines) |

## Functions

| Function | Return Type | Description |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| `TriggerFootstepEffect` | `void` | Triggers a footstep effect based on the specified foot (called from Anim Notifies) |
| `HandleSpecificMovementEffect` | `void` | Triggers a specific movement effect (like landing) where the type is known by the caller |

## Usage

1. Add this component to your character
2. Create a DataTable using the `FSurfaceEffectAssets` row structure, with rows for each surface type
3. Add anim notifies to your character's animations that call `TriggerFootstepEffect`
4. Create a Gameplay Cue Blueprint that inherits from `UMotionGameplayCueNotify_Static` to handle the effects
5. The component automatically handles landing effects via movement mode changes

## Requirements

- Your character must have an Ability System Component
- You must create a DataTable with `FSurfaceEffectAssets` row structure
- You must implement a Gameplay Cue (e.g., inheriting from `UMotionGameplayCueNotify_Static`)
- Your character animations should have anim notifies for footsteps

## Example

```cpp
// Inside your character class setup
UMotionMovementSoundComponent* MovementFXComp = CreateDefaultSubobject<UMotionMovementSoundComponent>(TEXT("MovementFXComponent"));
// Configuration is typically done in the editor
```

## Blueprint Usage

After adding the component to your character blueprint in the Components panel:

1. Select the MotionMovementSoundComponent in the Components panel
2. Assign your SurfaceEffectsTable DataTable
3. Configure socket names, trace settings, and other properties
4. Set up anim notifies in your animation blueprints that call TriggerFootstepEffect with the appropriate foot tag

## DataTable Setup

Create a DataTable with `FSurfaceEffectAssets` row structure:

1. For each surface type (e.g., Concrete, Grass), add a row using the PhysicalSurface enum name
2. Populate the sound arrays with variations for different movement types (walk, run, crouch, land)
3. Optionally add visual effects (particles, decals)
