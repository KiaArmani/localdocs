## Current Preview (Motion 2.0 Preview 1)

### Animation & Movement

* Turn-in-place functionality is broken due to a disconnected node in the Animation Blueprint.
* In multiplayer, jumping does not work as expected.
* When uncrouching while encroached, the player remains stuck in the crouched state.
* Camera height when crouching does not properly reflect the change in capsule size.
* When crouching, a stray "Hello" print string appears.

### Camera & Spring Arm

* Camera can clip through walls in some situations.
* If a Spring Arm is used, its functionality is partially overridden by the camera component.
* There is currently no way to debug the camera.
* Lack of HUD makes it difficult to evaluate the feel of camera curves.

### Debugging & Visibility

* "Show Debug Information" does not work on any component except Crouch.
* Capsule is visible by default when it should be hidden.
* Movement Sound component's capsule trace debug is enabled by default.

### Crouch Component

* Crouch component performs capsule traces even when not crouching.
* If the Ability System Component is spawned or added after this component's `BeginPlay`, a warning is triggered and the crouch component remains disabled for the rest of the session.

### Movement Sound Component

* When no surface is detected, no footsteps are played; a default (configurable) sound should play as fallback.
* `DeriveMovementTypeTagFromState()` can return an invalid tag at start (before GAS tags are applied), suppressing footsteps until a tag is set.
* PreviousVelocityZ is only cached if `OwningCharacterMovementComponent` is valid, but this pointer is never set in the class.
* If used on an `ACharacter` without a `UMotionComponent`, landing-velocity logic will silently break.
* `UEnum::GetValueAsString(EPhysicalSurface)` returns a string with the enum prefix and double-colon (e.g., "EPhysicalSurface::SurfaceType1"), which does not match data-table row names, causing lookups to fail and fallback to "Default".

### Speed Sync Component

* `UMotionSpeedSyncComponent` uses and sets the wrong member variable in several places (e.g., sets `OwningMotionCameraComponent` instead of `OwningAbilitySystemComponent`).
* `OwningAbilitySystemComponent` is not initialized in the constructor.
* `InitializeWithAbilitySystem` does not store the new ASC in `OwningAbilitySystemComponent`.
* Incorrect variable checks and assignments in shutdown and error handling logic.
