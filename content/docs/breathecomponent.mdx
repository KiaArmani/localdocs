# MotionBreatheComponent

The `UMotionBreatheComponent` adds a procedural breathing camera rotation effect based on the character's movement state. It requires a `UMotionCameraComponent` on the owning actor.

## Overview

This component automatically adds subtle camera movement when the character is idle (standing still), simulating natural breathing. The effect is paused when the character moves above a certain velocity threshold.

## Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `CameraBreathingCurve` | `FRuntimeVectorCurve` | Curve that defines the breathing animation pattern (applied to camera rotation) |
| `BreathingCurveIdentifier` | `FString` | Identifier used when adding/removing the curve from the Camera Component (default: "CameraBreathing") |
| `IdleVelocityThreshold` | `float` | Threshold velocity below which the character is considered idle and breathing effect is active (default: 5.0) |

## Usage

Simply add the component to your character. The component will automatically:

1. Find the `UMotionCameraComponent` on the same actor
2. Add a looping breathing curve to the camera rotation
3. Pause/unpause the curve based on character velocity

## Requirements

- A `UMotionCameraComponent` must be on the same actor
- A valid `CameraBreathingCurve` should be assigned in the editor

## Example

```cpp
// Inside your character class setup
UMotionBreatheComponent* BreatheComp = CreateDefaultSubobject<UMotionBreatheComponent>(TEXT("BreatheComponent"));
// Configuration can be done in the editor or in code
BreatheComp->IdleVelocityThreshold = 10.0f; // Increases velocity threshold for breathing effect
```

## Blueprint Usage

After adding the component to your character blueprint in the Components panel:

1. Select the MotionBreatheComponent in the Components panel
2. Configure the CameraBreathingCurve in the Details panel
3. Adjust the IdleVelocityThreshold if needed
4. Ensure your character has a MotionCameraComponent
