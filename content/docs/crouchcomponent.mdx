# MotionCrouchComponent

The `UMotionCrouchComponent` handles character crouching mechanics, including capsule resizing, collision checking, and camera adjustments.

## Overview

This component manages the physical aspects of crouching (capsule size, position, collision), responding to the `State.Movement.Crouching` gameplay tag in the Ability System. It does not manage input or speed modification, which should be handled by appropriate Gameplay Abilities and Effects.

## Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `bShowDebugInformation` | `bool` | Toggle to display debug information on screen |
| `CrouchCameraOffset` | `FRuntimeVectorCurve` | Curve that defines the camera offset during crouching |
| `TargetCrouchHalfHeight` | `float` | The target half height of the capsule when fully crouched |
| `CrouchInterpolationSpeed` | `float` | Speed at which the capsule interpolates its height (units per second) |

## Functions

| Function | Return Type | Description |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| `CanUncrouch` | `bool` | Checks if uncrouching to the standing height would cause collision |
| `PrintDebugInformation` | `void` | Prints debug information to screen |

## Usage

Add this component to your character and configure appropriate Gameplay Abilities that add/remove the `State.Movement.Crouching` gameplay tag. The component will:

1. Monitor the `State.Movement.Crouching` tag on the character's Ability System Component
2. When the tag is added, smoothly interpolate the capsule height to the `TargetCrouchHalfHeight`
3. When the tag is removed, check if uncrouching would cause collision and smoothly interpolate back to the original height if safe

## Requirements

- Your character must have an Ability System Component
- You need to create Gameplay Abilities that add/remove the `State.Movement.Crouching` tag
- You should create Gameplay Effects that modify speed when crouched

## Example

```cpp
// Inside your character class setup
UMotionCrouchComponent* CrouchComp = CreateDefaultSubobject<UMotionCrouchComponent>(TEXT("CrouchComponent"));
// Configuration can be done in the editor or in code
CrouchComp->TargetCrouchHalfHeight = 50.0f;
CrouchComp->CrouchInterpolationSpeed = 300.0f;
```

## Gameplay Ability Setup

Your crouch ability should:

1. Check `CanUncrouch()` on the server when attempting to stand up
2. Apply/remove the `State.Movement.Crouching` gameplay tag
3. Apply/remove a Gameplay Effect that modifies movement speed

## Blueprint Usage

After adding the component to your character blueprint in the Components panel:

1. Select the MotionCrouchComponent in the Components panel
2. Configure the TargetCrouchHalfHeight in the Details panel
3. Set the CrouchInterpolationSpeed to control transition smoothness
4. Create a corresponding GA_Crouch Gameplay Ability Blueprint
