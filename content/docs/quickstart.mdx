# Quick Start Guide

This guide covers the essential steps to get started with Motion 2.0 Preview, using the pre-made character and gameplay components.

## Setup

1. **Add the Plugin to Your Project**
   * Download the Release from Fab
   * Copy the `MotionCore` folder to your project's `Plugins` directory
   * Restart the Unreal Editor
   * Enable the plugin in Edit → Plugins → Motion Core
2. **Load the Default Map**
   * Open the default demonstration map at `Plugins/MotionCore/Content/Motion/Maps/Default`

## Using the Pre-made Character

1. **Find the Demo Character**
   * Locate `BP_MotionCharacter` in `Plugins/MotionCore/Content/Motion/Blueprints`
   * Drag this into your level or set it as the default pawn in your GameMode
2. **Play the Demo**
   * Press Play to test the character with all movement components pre-configured
   * Basic controls:
     * WASD: Movement
     * Space: Jump
     * Shift: Sprint
     * Ctrl: Crouch
     * Mouse: Look

## Exploring Pre-made Components

The character includes several pre-configured components:

* **Movement Components**:
  * Sprint Component: Enables sprint functionality
  * Crouch Component: Handles crouch transitions and state
  * Jump Component: Enhanced jump mechanics
  * Breathe Component: Adds camera breathing effects
* **Feedback Components**:
  * Movement Sound Component: Surface-aware footsteps and movement sounds
  * Speed Sync Component: Synchronizes animation speed with movement

## Testing the Gameplay Features

1. **Try Different Surfaces**
   * Walk across different materials to hear surface-specific footstep sounds
   * Notice how the character reacts differently to various surfaces
2. **Experiment with Movement Combinations**
   * Try sprint-jumping and observe momentum preservation
   * Test crouching while sprinting for a slide effect
   * Notice breathing effects during exertion
3. **Check Out the Animation Integration**
   * Observe how animations blend smoothly between states
   * Notice the tag-driven animation state transitions

## Next Steps

1. **Create Your Own Character**
   * Create a new Blueprint inheriting from `MotionCharacter` or `Character`
   * Add the desired Motion components to your character
   * Configure component settings to suit your gameplay style
2. **Customize Movement Feel**
   * Adjust component properties to create your desired movement feel
   * Experiment with different values for sprint speed, jump height, etc.
3. **Explore Advanced Features**
   * Try modifying the Gameplay Ability integration
   * Customize the animation tag mappings
   * Create new movement sound profiles
4. **Test Replication Support**
   * Use Play as Client option (Play > Advanced Settings > Number of Players: 2)
   * Observe how movement states replicate across clients
   * Test network movement prediction with different latency settings
5. **Create New Gameplay Abilities**
   * Design custom abilities using the Gameplay Ability System
   * Create new Gameplay Effects that modify character attributes
   * Implement input bindings for your custom abilities
