# MotionJumpComponent

The `UMotionJumpComponent` handles cosmetic effects and logic related to jumping. It primarily reacts to the `State.Movement.Jumping` gameplay tag and applies camera effects when jumping.

## Overview

This component is responsible for adding visual feedback when jumping, such as camera shakes or effects. The actual jump action (applying velocity, checking CanJump) should be handled by `ACharacter::Jump`, typically triggered via a Gameplay Ability.

## Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `bShowDebugInformation` | `bool` | Optional flag to show debug information |
| `JumpShakeCurveIdentifier` | `FString` | Identifier used when adding/removing the curve from the Camera Component (default: "JumpShake") |
| `JumpShakeCurve` | `FRuntimeVectorCurve` | Curve that defines the jump camera shake pattern (applied to camera rotation) |

## Functions

| Function | Return Type | Description |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| `PrintDebugInformation` | `void` | Prints current jump state and debug information to the screen |

## Usage

Add this component to your character and configure appropriate Gameplay Abilities that add the `State.Movement.Jumping` gameplay tag. The component will:

1. Monitor the `State.Movement.Jumping` tag on the character's Ability System Component
2. When the tag is added, apply the `JumpShakeCurve` to the character's `UMotionCameraComponent`
3. Automatically handle the one-shot camera effect

## Requirements

- Your character must have an Ability System Component
- You need to create Gameplay Abilities that add the `State.Movement.Jumping` tag
- For camera effects, your character needs a `UMotionCameraComponent`
- A valid `JumpShakeCurve` should be assigned

## Example

```cpp
// Inside your character class setup
UMotionJumpComponent* JumpComp = CreateDefaultSubobject<UMotionJumpComponent>(TEXT("JumpComponent"));
// Configuration is typically done in the editor
```

## Gameplay Ability Setup

Your jump ability should:

1. Call the standard `Character->Jump()` function to perform the physical jump
2. Apply the `State.Movement.Jumping` gameplay tag
3. Handle removing the tag when landing (typically done in the ability's EndAbility)

## Blueprint Usage

After adding the component to your character blueprint in the Components panel:

1. Select the MotionJumpComponent in the Components panel
2. Assign a JumpShakeCurve in the Details panel
3. Create a corresponding GA_Jump Gameplay Ability Blueprint
4. In your Gameplay Ability, ensure you add the State.Movement.Jumping tag when jumping
