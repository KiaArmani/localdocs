This guide explains how to set up the Motion Core plugin in your Unreal Engine project using primarily Blueprints, leveraging the component-based and Gameplay Ability System (GAS) integrated architecture.

## 1. Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure the following plugins are enabled in your project (Edit -> Plugins):

* **Enhanced Input:** For handling input actions.
* **Gameplay Abilities:** For character abilities, state management, and attribute handling.

## 2. Installation

1. Install the Motion Core plugin by placing the `MotionCore` folder into your project's `Plugins` directory.
2. Restart the Unreal Editor if it was open.
3. Verify the plugin is enabled in Edit -> Plugins -> Motion.

## 3. Character Blueprint Setup

The recommended approach is to add Motion Core components to your existing Character Blueprint (which should typically inherit from the standard `ACharacter`).&#x20;

The C++ classes `AMotionCharacter`, `UMotionInputComponent`, `UMotionAbilitySystemComponent`, and `AMotionPlayerController` have been removed; use the provided `B_MotionCharacter` Blueprint as an example reference.

**3.1. Required Engine Components:**

Ensure your Character Blueprint has the standard required components:

* **Capsule Component:** (Default)
* **Mesh (Skeletal Mesh Component):** (Default)
* **Character Movement Component:** (Default)
* **Ability System Component (ASC):**
  * Click "Add Component" in your Character Blueprint.
  * Search for and add the `Ability System` component.
  * Select the added ASC. In the Details panel, under Replication, set **Replication Mode** to `Mixed` or `Full` if making a multiplayer game.
  * *(For recommended PlayerState hosting, see section 3.4 below).*
* **Attribute Set:**
  * **Option A (Recommended Start - UMotionAttributeSet):** `UMotionAttributeSet` is provided and includes `MaxWalkSpeed`.
    * **C++ (Highly Recommended for PlayerState):** If you have a C++ `PlayerState` (see 3.4), add `UMotionAttributeSet` as a Default Subobject (DSO) in its constructor. This is the most robust method.
      ```cpp
      // In YourPlayerState.h
      // UPROPERTY(VisibleAnywhere, BlueprintReadOnly, Category = "Abilities")
      // TObjectPtr<UMotionAttributeSet> MotionAttributeSet;

      // In YourPlayerState.cpp constructor
      // MotionAttributeSet = CreateDefaultSubobject<UMotionAttributeSet>(TEXT("MotionAttributeSet"));
      ```
    * **Blueprint (Runtime Add):** If using a Blueprint-only Character/PlayerState, in `Begin Play` (or after `Init Ability Actor Info`), call `Add Attribute Set To Actor` (from `Motion Ability System Helper`) and select `UMotionAttributeSet`. Be aware of potential replication timing issues with runtime additions.
  * **Option B (Custom AttributeSet):** Create your own Blueprint or C++ AttributeSet inheriting from `UAttributeSet`. Add attributes like `MaxWalkSpeed`, `Stamina`, etc. Ensure you include a speed attribute.
    * **C++ DSO (Recommended):** Add it as a Default Subobject in your C++ `PlayerState` or `Character` constructor.
    * **Blueprint (Runtime Add):** Use `Add Attribute Set To Actor` with the same caveats as above.
  * **Attribute Synchronization:** To link the `MaxWalkSpeed` attribute to the Character Movement Component, add the `MotionSpeedSyncComponent` to your Character Blueprint. This component automatically finds the `UMotionAttributeSet` (or your specified attribute if customized) and `UCharacterMovementComponent` and keeps `CMC->MaxWalkSpeed` updated.
  * **Attribute Initialization:** For initial values:
    * **Constructor (C++):** Set defaults directly in your AttributeSet C++ constructor.
    * **`DefaultStartingData` (ASC):** Use the `DefaultStartingData` array on the AbilitySystemComponent for a Blueprint-friendly way to apply GameplayEffects that can initialize attributes at startup.
    * **`AttributeSetInitter` (Advanced):** For complex data-driven initialization (e.g., from CurveTables), you might explore patterns similar to Lyra's `AttributeSetInitter` (requires C++).

**3.2. Add Motion Core Components:**

Add the desired Motion Core C++ components using the "Add Component" button in your Character Blueprint:

* `MotionCrouchComponent` (Handles smooth capsule resizing based on Gameplay Tags)
* `MotionSprintComponent`
* `MotionJumpComponent`
* `MotionMovementSoundComponent` (Handles Movement FX via Gameplay Cues)
* `MotionCameraComponent` (Optional: If using procedural camera effects. Alternatively, use standard Spring Arm + Camera components).
* `MotionBreatheComponent` (Optional: Requires `MotionCameraComponent`).
* `MotionSpeedSyncComponent` (Recommended: If using `UMotionAttributeSet` for speed).

**3.3. Configure Components:**

Select your Character Blueprint, then select each added Motion Core component in the Components tab and configure its properties in the Details panel:

* **`MotionCrouchComponent`:**&#x20;
  * Set `Target Crouch Half Height` (the final height when crouched).&#x20;
  * Set `Crouch Interpolation Speed` (how fast the capsule resizes).&#x20;
  * Configure `Crouch Camera Offset` curve if desired.
* **`MotionMovementSoundComponent`:**&#x20;
  * Assign your **Surface Effects Table** (see Step 7).
  * Set `Generic Footstep Cue Tag` if different from default (`Motion.GameplayCue.Movement.FootstepFX`).&#x20;
  * Set `Footstep Socket L`/`R` names. Adjust `Surface Trace Channel`/`Distance`.&#x20;
  * Configure throttling properties (`Min Time Between Footsteps`, `Min Time Between Landings`).&#x20;
  * Configure environmental check properties (`Environment Check Radius`, `Channel`, `Wet Environment Actor Tag`) if desired.
* **`MotionCameraComponent`:**&#x20;
  * Configure `Camera Location Curves`, `Camera Rotation Curves`, `Camera Target Offset By Pitch`, View Limits, `Camera Socket Name`, etc.
* **`MotionBreatheComponent`:**&#x20;
  * Configure `Camera Breathing Curve`, `Breathing Curve Identifier`, `Idle Velocity Threshold`.
* **Other Components:**&#x20;
  * Configure `bShowDebugInformation` or other properties as needed.

## 4. Gameplay Ability Setup (GAS Assets)

Motion Core relies on GAS assets you create or modify.

1. **Create Abilities:** Right-click in Content Browser -> Blueprints -> Gameplay Ability Blueprint. Create abilities for Crouch, Sprint, Jump, etc. Use examples provided with the plugin as a guide.
2. **Create Effects:** Right-click in Content Browser -> Blueprints -> Gameplay Effect Blueprint. Create effects like `GE_Movement_CrouchSpeed`, `GE_Movement_SprintSpeed`.
   * Set Duration Policy to `Infinite` for persistent state effects (like crouch/sprint speed modifiers) or a specific duration for temporary buffs.
   * Add a Modifier targeting your speed attribute (e.g., `YourAttributeSet.MaxWalkSpeed`) with the desired operation (`Add (Final)` is recommended for temporary additive bonuses) and magnitude.
   * **For Gradual Effects (e.g., Sprint Ramp-up/down):** Use `Infinite` duration, `Period = 0.0`, `Add (Final)` modifier, and **`Set By Caller`** magnitude. The Gameplay Ability will need a Timer to periodically update the magnitude on the active effect handle.
3. **Grant Abilities/Effects:** In your Character Blueprint (e.g., on `Event Possessed` for server-granted, or `BeginPlay`), get the ASC and use `Give Ability` and `Apply Gameplay Effect To Self` to grant the default abilities and any passive effects needed.
   * **Important (Set By Caller):** When applying a GE spec that uses Set By Caller magnitude, you **must** initialize the magnitude value (e.g., to 0.0) using `Set Set By Caller Magnitude` (Blueprint `Make...Spec` node) or `SpecHandle.Data->SetSetByCallerMagnitude(...)` (C++) before applying the spec to avoid runtime errors.

## 5. Input Setup (Enhanced Input)

* **Create/Use Assets:** Ensure you have:
  * `UInputAction` assets (Right-click -> Input -> Input Action). Motion ships with actions for Move, Look, Crouch, Sprint, Jump, etc.
  * `UInputMappingContext` asset (Right-click -> Input -> Input Mapping Context). Map physical keys/buttons to your Input Actions within this context. Motion ships with a sample configuration.
* **Add Mapping Context:**&#x20;
  * In your Player Controller Blueprint (`Event BeginPlay`) or Character Blueprint (`Event BeginPlay` or `Event Possessed`), **ensure this logic only runs for the locally controlled player**.&#x20;
  * Use a Branch node checking **`Is Local Player Controller`** (if in Player Controller BP) or **`Is Locally Controlled`** (if in Character BP).&#x20;
  * If true, then: Get Player Controller -> Get Enhanced Input Local Player Subsystem -> Add Mapping Context (select your IMC asset). This works correctly in both singleplayer and multiplayer.
* **Bind Actions:** In your Character Blueprint's Event Graph, implement the `Setup Player Input Component` event (this event only runs on the locally controlled character):
  * Get the `Player Input Component` input pin -> Cast to `Enhanced Input Component`.
  * **Bind Movement/Look:**&#x20;
    * Drag off the cast node -> `Bind Action`.&#x20;
    * Select your `IA_Move`/`IA_Look` assets.&#x20;
    * Connect `Triggered` to your movement/look handling logic (e.g., calling `Add Movement Input`, `Add Controller Yaw/Pitch Input`).
  * **Bind Ability Actions (Recommended: Hybrid Approach):**
    * **Define Input IDs:** Create or use the `EMotionAbilityInputID` C++ enum (`Plugins/MotionCore/Source/MotionCore/Public/AbilitySystem/MotionAbilityInputID.h`) to define logical inputs (Sprint, Jump, Crouch, etc.).
    * **Define Gameplay Event Tags:** Create tags for ability activation triggers (e.g., `Input.Ability.Sprint`, `Input.Ability.Jump`). Add in Project Settings -> Project -> Gameplay Tags.
    * **Grant Abilities (Server):** On `Event Possessed` (Server side), use `Give Ability`. In the `Make GameplayAbilitySpec` node, set the **`Input ID`** pin using your `EMotionAbilityInputID` enum value (e.g., `Sprint`). This links the ability instance to the logical input for release tasks like `Wait Input Release`.
    * **Configure Ability Triggers (GA Asset):** In each Gameplay Ability asset (e.g., `GA_Motion_Sprint`), set the **Ability Trigger** (Class Defaults) to use **`Gameplay Event`** as the `Trigger Source` and the corresponding activation tag (e.g., `Input.Ability.Sprint`) as the `Trigger Tag`.
    * **Bind Input (Client):** On `Event Possessed` (Client side, check `Is Locally Controlled`):
      * Get the ASC and Enhanced Input Component (use `Get Enhanced Input Component From Actor` helper).
      * Call **`Bind Enhanced Input Action to ASC`** (from `Motion Ability System Helper`) for each ability input. Provide the ASC, Input Component, the `UInputAction` asset, and the corresponding `EMotionAbilityInputID` enum value. This handles calling `AbilityLocalInputPressed/Released` to track the input state for the ASC.
      * Use the standard **`Bind Action`** node for each ability input `UInputAction`. Connect the **`Started`** pin to **`Send Gameplay Event to Actor`**, targeting `Self` and using the activation Gameplay Event Tag (e.g., `Input.Ability.Sprint`). This triggers the ability's activation.
      * *(Workaround for UE5.5)* If `Wait Input Release` proves unreliable, connect the **`Completed`** pin of the `Bind Action` node to the **`Trigger Ability Input Released`** helper function, providing the ASC and the correct `EMotionAbilityInputID`.

## 6. Animation Setup

* **Create AnimBP:** Create an Animation Blueprint inheriting from `MotionAnimInstance` (or your own child class of it) for your character's Skeletal Mesh.
* **Get Variables in AnimBP:** In the AnimBP's Event Graph (`Event Blueprint Initialize Animation`):&#x20;
  1. Get Owning Actor -> Cast to your Character BP. Get Character Movement Component -> Promote to variable (`CMC`). *(Note: The C++ base class `MotionAnimInstance` already attempts to get the ASC here, but it might be too early).*
* **Initialize AnimBP from Character:** In your **Character Blueprint**, after you have confirmed the Ability System Component is valid and initialized (e.g., in `Event Possessed` after calling `Initialize Ability Actor Info`, and potentially also after client-side initialization if needed):
  * Get your Mesh component -> Get Anim Instance -> Cast to your `MotionAnimInstance` child class.
  * If the cast is valid: Get your Ability System Component reference -> Call the `Initialize With Ability System` function on the casted Anim Instance node. This ensures the Anim Instance connects to the ASC once it's ready.
* **Link Anim Layers (Optional):** If you need to link Anim Layers dynamically (e.g., based on equipment), do this in your Character BP's `BeginPlay` or `Event Possessed`. **Ensure this logic only runs for the locally controlled player** using a Branch node checking **`Is Locally Controlled`**. If true, get the Mesh component and call `Link Anim Class Layers`.
* **Update Variables in AnimBP:** In `Event Blueprint Update Animation`: Use the `Gameplay Tag Property Map` feature (configured in the AnimBP Class Defaults) which automatically updates linked boolean variables based on tags in the ASC (if `InitializeWithAbilitySystem` was successful). Get the `CMC` variable -> Get Velocity, Is Falling, etc., and set corresponding AnimBP variables. You can also manually check tags using **`Has Matching Gameplay Tag`** if needed, but the property map is often cleaner.
* **State Machine:** Use the boolean state variables (e.g., `bIsSprinting`, `bIsCrouching`, `bIsJumping`, updated by the Gameplay Tag Property Map) and other variables like Speed in your AnimGraph State Machine transitions and to select animations (Blend Spaces, Sequences).
* **Anim Notifies:**&#x20;
  * In walk/run/sprint animations, add Anim Notifies at footstep keyframes.&#x20;
  * In the AnimBP's Event Graph, implement the corresponding `AnimNotify_Footstep_L`/`_R` events.&#x20;
  * Get Owning Actor -> Get Component By Class (`MotionMovementSoundComponent`) -> Call `Trigger Footstep Effect`, passing the appropriate foot Gameplay Tag (e.g., `Motion.Movement.Sound.Foot.Left`).

## 7. Movement FX Setup (Replaces Movement Sound Setup)

* **Define Tags:** Ensure the necessary Gameplay Tags are defined in your project (Project Settings -> Gameplay Tags). You'll need tags for:
  * Movement Types (e.g., `Motion.Movement.Sound.Type.Walk`, `Motion.Movement.Sound.Type.Sprint`, `Motion.Movement.Sound.Type.Land.Light`, `Motion.Movement.Sound.Type.Land.Hard`)
  * Foot Types (e.g., `Motion.Movement.Sound.Foot.Left`, `Motion.Movement.Sound.Foot.Right`)
  * Character Weight (e.g., `Motion.Character.Weight.Light`, `Motion.Character.Weight.Medium`, `Motion.Character.Weight.Heavy`)
  * Effect Profiles (e.g., `Motion.Character.EffectProfile.Stealth`, `.Normal`, `.Heavy`) - Optional, if using profiles.
  * Environmental Context (e.g., `Motion.Environment.State.Wet`, `Motion.Environment.Location.Indoor`) - Optional, if using environmental detection.
  * The generic Cue Tag (e.g., `Motion.GameplayCue.Movement.FootstepFX`)
  * Relevant Character States (e.g., `Motion.State.Movement.Sprinting`, `Motion.State.Movement.Crouching`)
    *(Refer to `MotionGameplayTags.h` for the tags defined natively by the plugin).*
* **Create DataTable:** Create a **DataTable** asset (Miscellaneous -> Data Table). Choose `FSurfaceEffectAssets` as the row structure.
* **Populate DataTable:** Add rows, using the `EPhysicalSurface` enum name as the Row Name (e.g., `SurfaceType1`, `SurfaceType2`, `Default`). For each row (surface type):
  * Fill the `WalkSounds`, `RunSounds`, `CrouchSounds`, `LandLightSounds`, `LandHardSounds` arrays (`FWeightBasedSoundVariations`) with \`
